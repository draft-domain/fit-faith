# Project Rules

- Always read `PLANNING.md` and `TASK.md` before starting a task.
- Work one task at a time. Ask if scope is unclear.
- Keep any single file under ~500 lines.
- Explain non-obvious edits in comments.
- Do not touch secrets or `.env`.
- After each task, update:
  - `README.md` (what changed, how to run/test)
  - `TASK.md` (move done items, add new items under Discovered During Work)
